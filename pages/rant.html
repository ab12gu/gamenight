            Seattle has a reputation of "Seattle Freeze", where people give each other the cold shoulder and don't really socialize with "newbies".

            But, Seattle is one of the fastest growing cities in the nation! 
            <br><br>

            At least, when I moved here, I felt like I wanted to meet people and started to look for events in the area pretty quickly. But oftentimes, people aren't super forthcoming at these places and it sucks walking into a new environment.
            <br><br>

            Here, at gamenight, you at least know me, and I will try to get you to form some new friendships here but also just be someone to lean on if you don't have the bandwidth to talk to other newbies that night.

            It also ties back into the moral of novel, <i>Bowling alone</i>. The idea is that America is becoming more segregated because we don't bowl together anymore. Neighbors used to help each other and people will be in local sports leagues, participate in Sunday church, and even bowl together. 
            <br><br>

            However, we have lost these interactions and barely even know how our neighbors look or even their name. We may even start resenting their mere existance because their dog that you've never even seen, barks too much!
            <br><br>

            This makes us divided. Socially. Polictically. Monetarily. 
            <br><br>

            But we can start moving back towards a more hollistic community!
